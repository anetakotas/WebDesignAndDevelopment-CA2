1. Executive Summary
My team and I have been employed by small fruit and vegetable shop Mick’s Garden 
to create, design and deploy a website for his business. He requires this website as 
he wishes to modernise his small business and increase sales and revenue by 
attracting more customers to his shop. His requirements for his site are as follows:
• Homepage with info about the company
• A catalogue of the produce he sells with info about the produce.
• A page which contains ways to contact the business.
• A page which provides directions and ways to get to the shop.
• A sign-up form for his company newsletter
• A quiz game which enters users into a draw for a shop voucher
The sitemap for the requirements I will include below.
He also would like the colour scheme to reflect the fact that his business is Irish and 
sells Irish produce, so use of green tones is important as well as appealing images of 
produce being sold.

My team and I decided on this idea as we all have an interest in food and also 
because of the vast amounts of open-source images of fruits and vegetables which 
could be used in our site.
The name Mick’s Garden is a play on a real-life small business called “Mattress 
Micks,” it also fits the profile of a small family-owned Irish fruit and veg store perfectly 
in our opinion.

3. Design Process
We opted to go for a very striking and bold colour pattern, the colour we used are very 
modern and fit the needs of Micks Garden as they are trying to branch out and attract 
a more modern audience into their shop, we feel our colour palette achieves this 
perfectly. We also incorporated background images of fruit to the website which adds 
to the realistic look of the site. We created a mood board with our logo which was 
created in photoshop and a few images and colours pallets prior to starting work. I will 
include this below.
The fonts we used for this site were chosen for the same reasons as the colours to 
give a fresh and modern image to this business, the fonts we used from google fonts 
are as follows.
• Slabo 27px
• Poppins
The images we have chosen for this website are all open source as per the 
requirements. When looking for the images to use we had the objective of finding 
images which could display the sores stock in the most appealing way, this would be 
crucial to attract customers to the shop from the website. Our images we chose are 
100% royalty free and from unsplash.com, examples provided below.

All images on the website were edited and cropped according to the requirements, 
and so that the website can load faster.

Before we began working on the website, we created wireframes which I will include 
below.

4. Testing & Responsiveness
When designing the JavaScript for this website we tried to minimise the amount of 
code used and used functions wherever we could as to not be writing the same code 
multiple times.
The majority of the JavaScript was focused on two pages, the newsletter sign-up and 
quiz. You can also find it on other pages, like index, offer and contact us. For the 
newsletter, the majority of the JavaScript was to validate the information being input 
into the form, this was mainly done through the use of if statements which checked if 
the correct info was being input, and same goes for contact us page. For the quiz a 
loop was used to check the answers to the quiz, an array was used to store answers 
and the built in Math class was used to generate random numbers for the randomly 
generated question. Index page has a review section where content can be changed 
accordingly to chosen option, and that was achieved by switch statement. On offer 
page user can check availability of certain products thanks to JavaScript arrays, loops 
and if statements. 
The JavaScript for these pages was tested extensively, for the newsletter sign-up and 
contact page multiple inputs were entered into each field to check that it was validated 
properly. For the quiz, it was played multiple times to make sure that the random 
numbers were generated properly and that the answers when selected were returning 
the right result (correct or incorrect). Index and offer pages were also tested multiple 
times by clicking specific options and checking if right information is connected to right 
reviewer, and item checker was tested by typing multiple items in to check if answers 
were correct.
The website is made responsive through the use of flexbox and our navbar, as well as 
collapse elements and gallery carousel on about us page, are created using the 
bootstrap framework.
We opted to deploy the website on Vercel as we felt it is a great resource and is very 
intuitive and easy to use as it grabs code directly from a GitHub repository. 
We maximised our SEO for the website by including doing the following.
• Included keywords in the meta tags.
• Cropped all images to the correct size and converted to avif format.
• Validated our html and CSS with W3C validator in VScode.
• Removed any unused elements.
• Corrected contrasts between background and text in elements
• Added labels to each input
I will include below the before and after of our SEO (screenshot is only for index page 
but rest of the pages had similar results).

5. Conclusion
Overall, as a team we feel that the project went well, we all worked together well in the 
design and implementation of this website. In our opinion the hardest part of this 
project was the producing of the initial idea for the website.
Looking at our finished product we feel as though we have produced a great website 
for this small business and it fulfils all the requirements that were asked of us. If we 
had more time however, we would like to add more pages and increase the number 
of items in the stores catalogue, we also would try to optimise the site more for mobile 
use.
